# My Personal Website

Used a basic Gatsby Starter: Mate (Copyright (c) 2018 Emanuel Suriano) with a lot of edits. Changed some of the colours and design. Will probably continue to edit this in the future to make it look prettier/include more features.

TODO:
- add dark theme
- maybe change design?
